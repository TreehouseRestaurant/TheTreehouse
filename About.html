            <h1>Approach</h1>
            <p>The Treehouse is a friendly and quiet escape for all who love vegan food. We pride ourselves on creating an inclusive and welcoming environment in our restaurant. The Treehouse serves a wide range of vegan foods and healthy smoothies at affordable prices. Customers can work on projects and socialize while enjoying a delicious meal with no artificial ingredients. We focus on being eco-friendly with our energy sources by prioritizing using natural light to illuminate and heat our space. The Treehouse wants to be known as a home away from home and an alternative hangout spot to common coffee shops. We adhere to all food-safety protocols, have an interesting approach to self-sustainability, and heavily rely on Farm-to-Table strategies to support local farmers.</p>

        <h1>Farm To Table</h1>
        <p>Farm to Table is very important to us here at The Treehouse. We source from local farmers in New Mexico: Sierra County Farmers Market, Española Farmers Market, and other sellers in New Mexico that grow fresh fruit and vegetables. These growers give us our base ingredients that rotate seasonaly, including cucumbers, pumpkins, seeds, pomegranates, raspberries, onions, eggplants, squash, pears, apples, corn, melons, tea, horno bread and more. Prioritizing local markets and supporting smaller farmers is one of the best ways to bring fresh and cultured food to our customers. We also grow plants at our restaurant to give the feeling that the customers are “eating right off the vine.” We try to support local farmers and participate in a more sustainable food sourcing method to make veganism more accessible and fun.</p>

            <h1>Preparation Process</h1>
            <p>The Treehouse has extensive training and our staff handcrafts all of our menu items. We guarantee to never have any meat or animal products on the premises so there would be no concern of cross contamination of our utensils and preparation areas. Employees also blend smoothies and serve entries on food-safe leaf plates for an extra fun touch. We maintain locally grown plants to show our customers the beauty of eating vegan food. Our food is preservative-free and always freshly made. </p>

            <h1>Sustainability</h1>
            <p>For sustainability we use farm-to-table methods from locally grown food, sourced from smaller farmers/markets. This allows for us to conserve gas to be used in moving any product around. The Treehouse also prides itself in saving water, recycling and reusing materials. By using leaf plates we avoid using additional materials such as plastics which create waste. Additionally, other smaller plants are grown on-site ready to be used in our Treehouse; so our customers are practically eating right off the plant! We rarely use lights and designed our space to use open windows and the sun to light our calm and beautiful restaurant. Solar panels are secured to our roof to catch the sun and power electric stoves and our refrigerators. Using this green energy helps us avoid any fossil fuels and releases less pollution.</p>
