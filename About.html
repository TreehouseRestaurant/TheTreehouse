                <p>We are a friendly and quiet escape for everyone. We make sure our customers are treated with respect by our positive employees. We serve small foods and smoothies at affordable prices so customers can work on projects while enjoying a light and healthy snack with no artificial ingredients. By mainly using the sun to warm up and brighten our Treehouse, we want to be known as a home away from home and an alternative hangout spot instead of coffee shops. We adhere to all food safety protocols, have an interesting approach to self-sustainability, and heavily rely on Farm-to-Table strategies to support local farmers.

                <p>Farm to table is “a social movement that involves restaurants serving food from locally grown sources instead of processed slop”. This ensures freshness, sustainability, and transparency in our supply chain.It promotes using seasonal, organic and minimally processed ingredients. Farm to table also helps the planet grow healthier by reducing environmental impacts of transportation and for smaller local food markets and farmers to gain stability and increased revenue. 
                    What we do, We source from local farmers in New Mexico like: Sierra Country Farmers Market, Española farmers Market, and any other smaller farmers in New Mexico that grow fresh fruit and vegetables. These markets give us our base ingredients that rotate based on the season, including cucumbers, pumpkins, seeds, pomegranates, raspberries, onions, eggplants, squash, pears, apples, corn, melons, tea, Horno bread. We mainly use local markets and support smaller farmers to bring fresh and cultured food to the tables of our customers. We also grow our own plants at our restaurant to give the feeling that the customers are “eating right off the vine”. The food we get from our local markets are unique and not commonly used in most meals. That's why we encourage our customers to try new things and partake in the Vegan diet as they could also try and replicate the meals at home from the local farmers market. <br>We pride ourselves in fully supporting local farmers. </p>

                <p>We have extensive training and our staff handcrafts all of our menu items. We focus on not ever having any meat or animal products in the building so that there would be no concern of cross contamination of our utensils and preparation areas. We also blend smoothies and serve food on food safe leaves for an extra fun touch. We maintain locally grown plants to show our customers the beauty of eating vegan food</p>

                <p>For sustainability we use farm to table methods from locally grown food sourced from smaller farmers/markets. We also pride ourselves to save on water, recycle and reuse materials. By using leaf plates we avoid using additional materials for plates such as plastics and metals. Additional other smaller plants are grown on sight and ready to use in our Treehouse so the customers are practically eating right off the plant. We rarely use lights and focus more on the use of open windows and the sun to light our calm and beautiful restaurant. </p>
